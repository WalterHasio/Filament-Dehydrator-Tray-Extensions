# Filament-Dehydrator-Tray-Extensions
Extensions for a small Westinghouse food dehydrator*, these make it possible to use the dehydrator for drying filament or annealing PLA.  The trays that come with the dehydrator can be used instead if you break inside plastic, I printed these extensions instead.
