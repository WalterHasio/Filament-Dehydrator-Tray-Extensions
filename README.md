Extensions for a small Westinghouse food dehydrator*, these make it possible to use the dehydrator for drying filament or annealing PLA.  The trays that come with the dehydrator can be used instead if you break inside plastic, I printed these extensions instead.

The smaller 40mm extension will only work on thinner spools, like the newer Taulman nylon spools or 1lb Ninjaflex spools.  The larger 100mm extension should work with any spool I've encountered up to 1kg.  Multiple extensions can be stacked if you want to dry more than one spool at a time

I usually use the lowest settings to dry filament, the higher temperatures will warp PLA.

Printed in natural Taulman PLAdium*.  You'll want to use something more heat resistant if you plan to turn up the temperature all the way though. The overhang is angled so it should be printable without support material
